    <h2 class="heading">Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>This chili originated from when I lived at my first apartment in Balston Spa New York. The idea was to make the most food possible for the least cost. It ended up being good enough to optimize later (although a little more expensive). I love this recipe because it has so many strange ingredients that you would not expect to find in chili, and makes the most savory chili ever.</p>
