# odin-recipes

Small site to showcase the skills I have learned the past few weeks on The Odin Project in HTML.

My biggest issues with this project were:

Initially, I created the directory in the wrong location to push with git.
	Future fix: repositories created through Github belong in the repos folder.

I cannot spell sandwich correctly which (pun intended) caused a fair amount of difficulty with file names being named inconsistently
	Future fix: before using a word that is difficult to spell frequently, decide on a common shorthand for it.

I have a low level of knowledge on what I am doing using git. This was compounded when the directory was created in the wrong location in bash.
	Future fix: follow instructions better and summarize the use of git for this below.


Use of Git:

Create the repository on Git hub with a readme file.
Use SSH key on Git Hub to clone the repository (click to copy)
Use bash to make a directory with the same name in the repos folder.
In bash, cd into the new directory.
Use the command: git clone (copied SSH key) 
	---> format is: program(git)|Action(clone)|Destination(SSH Key)
	This connects the Git Hub repository to the one on my computer
Git status tells you what is not staged in red
Git add <filename or . (period)> adds the file (or all files in the directory) to the staging area
Git status after Git add tells you what is staged in green
Git commit -m "Something meaningful about the change you made"
Git push (origin main - will be useful in the future) uploads the files to Git Hub
